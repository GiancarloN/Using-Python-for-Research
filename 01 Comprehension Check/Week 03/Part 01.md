# Case study 01: DNA Translation

- **Which of the following is NOT a nucleotide**
	> Lysine
	
- **What is the central dogma of molecular biology that describes the basic flow of information?**
	> DNA → RNA → Protein
	
- **According to the NCBI, what are the first 10 nucleotides from the gene with accession number `NM_201917.1`?**
	> `gtaacaacca`
	
- **For a string `text`, what does the string method `text.replace("X", "Y")` do?**
	> It is a method that creates a new string by replacing all instances of `"X"` in the string with `"Y"`. 
	
- **Use `table` as defined as in Video 3.1.4. The file `table.py` is available to [download here](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/3a8ec7081b9692ecf087871ad649abf3/asset-v1:HarvardX+PH526x+3T2023+type@asset+block/table.py)as well as below the video.
  What is `table["GCC"]`?
	> `A`
	
- **What is `138 % 13`?**
	> `8`
	
- **Open a session of Python and follow the instructions in Video 3.1.2 to read in the NCBI DNA sequence with the accession number NM_207618.2 and store as `seq`.
  What does `seq[40:50]` return?**
	> `CCTGAAAACC`
	
- **What is a docstring?**
	> A string that describes details about a module, function, class, or method accessed by `help()`.
	
- **What does the `with` statement do?**
	> It opens a file and uses it for the subsequent clock of code only, and the closes the file.
	
- **Recall the final part of Video 3.1.5 regarding slicing. `translate` and `dna` are both as defined in that video.
  What does `translate(dna[20:938])[:-1] == translate(dna[20:935])` return?**
	> `True`
